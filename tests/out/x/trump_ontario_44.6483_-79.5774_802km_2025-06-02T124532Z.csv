‚Ä¢  Elon Musk (born in South Africa): Appointed as co-leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside Vivek Ramaswamy in Trump‚Äôs second administration. Musk, a naturalized U.S. citizen, immigrated from South Africa and is known for his entrepreneurial ventures like Tesla and SpaceX.
‚Ä¢  Aileen Cannon (born in Colombia): Appointed as a federal judge in the Southern District of Florida during Trump‚Äôs first term. Cannon, whose mother fled Cuba, has been noted for rulings perceived as favorable to Trump, though she faced criticism for alleged bias.
‚Ä¢  Mira Ricardel (born in Denmark): Served as Deputy National Security Advisor in Trump‚Äôs first administration. Born to Croatian parents in Denmark, she immigrated to the U.S. and held significant roles in national security.
‚Ä¢  Dina Powell (born in Egypt): Appointed as Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy in Trump‚Äôs first term. Powell immigrated to the U.S. from Egypt as a child and later served as a key figure in Middle East policy and U.S. global engagement.
These appointees held prominent roles.
It‚Äôs worth noting that Trump‚Äôs administration also included key figures like Stephen Miller, a native-born U.S. citizen of immigrant descent (his family came from Eastern Europe), who was a senior advisor and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, known for architecting restrictive immigration policies like the travel ban and family separations. While Miller himself is not an immigrant, his family background highlights the complex interplay of heritage and policy in Trump‚Äôs administration.
